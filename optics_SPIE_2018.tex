\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:intro}  

%\comr{Probe study language copied directly from Brian's paper (May 6th).  What level of repeat is useful?  What is appropriate?}
%\comb{Answer: you shouldn't copy the same text. Find a different way to say the same thing, or simply point people to the other paper.} 

Currently,  NASA funded spaces missions in astronomy and astrophysics are either Explorer missions with \$250M cost caps or flagship missions 
such as JWST which cost around \$3-\$5B. 
To study the science opportunities available at intermediate costs, NASA called for studies of `Probe' class missions with \$1B cost caps.  The Probe of Inflation 
and Cosmic Origins (PICO) is one of these NASA funded studies.  This paper describes the instrument optical design and focal plane approximately two 
thirds of the way through the study time line.  The final PICO report will be sent to NASA at the end of 2018.

% AT's text.
% In astronomy and astrophysics, NASA currently flies small and medium Explorer missions ($<$\$250M), as well as multi-billion-dollar flagship observatories like JWST and WFIRST. There are a number of science opportunities that are beyond the scope of the Explorer program, but don't require flagship-level funding. To explore these opportunities, NASA has funded studies of 10 `Probe' class (\$400M-\$1B) mission concepts. The Probe of Inflation and Cosmic Origins (PICO) is one of these mission studies. Reports of these mission studies are due to NASA at the end of the 2018 and NASA's plan is to forward the reports for consideration by the next Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal panel. This paper comes part way through the PICO study, and describes a snapshot of the  instrument design at this time in the study.

Astrophysical observations in the  millimeter and sub-millimeter region of the electromagnetic spectrum contain a wealth of 
information about the formation, evolution, and structure of the Universe.  
The polarization and temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave 
background (CMB) encode fundamental physics information relating to the epoch of inflation, the mass of neutrinos,  
and the number of relic light particles in the early Universe. They also contain information about the formation of 
the first stars, galaxies, and clusters.  Information about the role of magnetic fields in star formation and galactic evolution is obtainable 
by observing the polarized emission of Galactic dust, which 
traces magnetic fields, at high resolution. Targeting both of these regimes, PICO will survey the entire sky with 
unprecedented polarization sensitivity 
in 21 bands centered at 21--799~GHz.  Details of these science targets and expected constraints from PICO 
are in a companion paper, Sutin~et~al.\cite{brian_spie} 
In this paper we discuss the mission's optical system, focal plane, and sensitivity.


%\comb{old: Large scale cosmological and fundamental 
%physics information, such as 
%evidence of inflation, the effect of the first stars and galaxies, constraints on neutrino masses, and limits on light particles beyond

%background (CMB). } 

\section{SPACECRAFT AND MISSION}
\label{sec:spacecraft}

%  This could all be in the intro instead. Purpose is to show constraints on the optics to motivate decisions discussed later.  

PICO will conduct scientific observations for five years from the Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point. The spacecraft design impacts 
the optical design and sensitivity in two primary ways; volume constraints limit the physical size of the telescope and optical component 
temperatures impact noise levels.  

The maximum size of the spacecraft is limited by the launch vehicle, SpaceX's Falcon 9, which carries payloads up to 4.6~m in diameter. 
This diameter limit sets the V-groove size which, along with the scan strategy, defines the `shadow cone' in Figure~\ref{fig:cad}.  
The shadow cone is the volume protected from solar illumination, and all optical components must remain within it. The shadow cone and 
inner V-grooves define an available volume for the telescope.  

The temperatures of all optical elements are given in Figure~\ref{fig:cad} 
The optics box, secondary, and focal plane are actively cooled, 
details of the thermal system are given in Sutin~et~al.\cite{brian_spie}.

\section{OPTICAL SYSTEM}
\label{sec:optics}

The PICO telescope is a 1.4~m aperture modified open-Dragone.  This choice was driven by a combination of science
requirements and the physical limits discussed in Section~\ref{sec:spacecraft}.  The science requirements are: a large diffraction 
limited field of view (DLFOV) sufficient to support $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ detectors, arcminute resolution at 800~GHz, low 
instrumental polarization, and low sidelobe response. Additionally, 
the transition edge sensor bolometers baselined for PICO require a telecentric focal plane which is sufficiently flat that it 
can be tiled by 10~cm detector wafers without reduction in optical quality. 

More than 30 years ago Dragone analyzed the 
performance of several off-axis systems and found solutions with low cross-polarization at the center of the field 
of view and with astigmatism, or astigmatism and coma, canceled to first order.\cite{dragone,dragone_coma,dragone1983}
A number of recent CMB instruments used off-axis systems, and several 
began the design optimization with systems based on designs by
Dragone\cite{planck2000_optics,ACT2011_optics,SPT2008_optics,core2018_inst,LB2016_optics}. For PICO we began 
the optimization with a Dragone system that to our knowledge has not been implemented before. 
We call it an `open-Dragone' because of its overall geometry, see Figure~\ref{fig:ray}, and in contrast to the widely 
used `cross-Dragone'. 

%\comr{An advantage of the open-Dragone system relative to the cross-Dragone is that it is easier to baffle the focal plane
%and thus to eliminate side-lobes. An advantage relative to a Gregorian design is that it has larger DLFOV. Our studies 
%indicate however that for the same aperture size and focal length, a cross system has a DLFOV that is $\sim$1.3 times 
%larger than the open. CHECK. 1.1? 1.2? 1.3?}

%\comr{This is an important paragraph. I started making comments along these lines earlier. Need to move the paragraph 
%earlier to motivate the use of the Open system.}
We consider two additional Dragone systems; a Gregorian Dragone and a cross-Dragone. We compare their performance to 
an open-Dragone using 155~GHz diffraction limited area, measured in units of $(F\lambda)^2$, as our metric. 
%Using $(F\lambda)^2$ is a fairer comparison than cm$^2$ or deg$^2$ as it takes the different $F$-numbers of the systems into account.
%similar to that planned for CORE or LiteBIRD \comb{I don't think Planck is formally a Dragone system; nothing is really 'planned' for CORE, as it is not in development}.  
With half the diffraction limited focal plane 
area of the open-Dragone,\cite{core2018_inst} the Gregorian Dragone is unable to support $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ detectors, so it was rejected.  
The cross-Dragone has roughly $4\times$ the diffraction limited focal plane area of the open-Dragone, 
\comr{is that true? I didn't think it was that much of a difference} \como{true for our open vs a crossed of the same aperture and similar geometry to EPIC. This is only a factor of 2 in DLFOV diameter. }
but it has significant sidelobes as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sidelobes}. Additionally, a cross-Dragone will always have a larger $F$-number 
than a similar open-Dragone, because the cross-Dragone focal length must be long enough that the focal plane does not block the primary mirror.
% \comr{why does it 'always' have larger F? Can make a smaller F, no?}. \como{The smallest f-number of a crossed system is about 2. The focal length has to be long so the focal plane doesn't block the primary. You could make an open with F > 2, but you can't make a crossed system with F < 2.}
The larger $F$-number results in a larger telescope which fits poorly into the shadow cone. The largest cross-Dragone 
that meets the PICO volume constraints has 
a 1.2~m aperture while the largest open-Dragone aperture is 1.4~m. The large $F$-number of the cross-Dragone system also increases 
the physical focal plane size, and therefore mass and cost, for a fixed number of pixels.  
These disadvantages with the Gregorian Dragone and the cross-Dragone led us to use the open-Dragone as a starting point for the PICO optical design.

We design the initial open Dragone following Granet's method\cite{granet2001}. 
We find a solution with low f-number, $F=1.42$, the largest aperture that satisfies the volume constraints, and a large 
DLFOV.  We force a circular aperture stop 
between the primary and secondary mirrors and numerically optimize its angle and position to obtain the best 
optical performance.  The stop diameter provides an effective 1.4~m aperture on the primary for the center feed.  
Adding a stop in this way increases the size of the primary mirror, because the primary is unevenly illuminated at various 
field angles.
Actively cooling the aperture stop, however, reduces detector noise and the stop shields the 
focal plane from stray radiation. At this stage the system still meets 
the Dragone condition and is defined by the `Initial Open-Dragone' parameters in Table~\ref{tab:optics}.

In his publications Dragone provides a prescription to eliminate coma
in addition to the cancellation of astigmatism in the baseline designs.\cite{dragone_coma} The reflector corrections 
involve adding distortions to the primary and secondary reflectors 
which are proportional to $r^4$ where $r=0$ is at the chief ray impact point on each mirror. 
We thus attempt to increase the DLFOV using two methods. 

In the first method, one of the coauthors (RH) uses Zemax to add Zernike 
polynomials to the base conics which describe the mirrors. These Zernike polynomials are offset from the symmetry axis of the conic 
by $624.2$~cm for the primary and $76.1$~cm for the secondary.  
This places the origin of polynomials at the chief ray impact point for each mirror. 
Inspired by the Dragone corrections, all Zernike terms up to fourth order and the first fifth order term are allowed to vary. 
The optimization metric is minimization of the rms spot diameter at 
the following locations: the center of the FOV, $\pm2$\dgr\ in Y, and $\pm4$\dgr\ in X. The center of the FOV is given a weight of 100
while each outer point is given a weight of 1. To constrain the optimization, the X and Y 
effective focal lengths are held fixed as is the impact point of the chief ray on the focal plane. 

This optimization step increases the DLFOV
by 15\% at 21~GHz, by 2.4$\times$ at 155~GHz, and by 
10.5$\times$ at 799~GHz. 
\comr{1. is this proper English? 2.4$\times$? I don't think so. 2. Why change between \% and $\times$? \como{1. Yes, according to Erin.} \como{2. Because 1050\% is awkward, as is 1.15$\times$.} 
We improve the system further by including a curved focal surface, allowing the radius of 
curvature to vary, and rerunning the optimization.  
This gives a 50\% increase in diffraction limited area at all frequencies over the Zernike polynomials alone.  
Finally, an approximately 4\% additional gain in area can be achieved by adding Zernike terms 
up to sixth order, allowing the secondary to focal surface distance to vary, adding a weighted constraint on the effective focal length, 
and adding fields with weight of 0.01 to the rms spot diameter metric at $\pm7.5$\dgr\ in Y and $+15$\dgr\ in X. 
These additional fields are necessary to constrain the corrections at the mirror edges.

 \comr{The other method by Richard has the first step of converting the conics into an on axis XY polynomial representation. Then a similar procedure is followed.  It is less well behaved during optimization.  This second Richard method is what I replicated in CodeV.}
 \comb{is this 'other method' = method2? or is it 1b? \como{KY: My method is 1b and not discussed here.}}

%To increase the optical performance we use CodeV to numerically optimize the system.  
In the second optimization method, another coauthor (JM) uses CodeV and allows more of the geometric 
parameters of the system to vary.  To adjust the 
mirror shapes, we add Zernike polynomial corrections to the conic surfaces which define the two mirrors.
The Zernike polynomials are defined on the same coordinates as the base conics.  
We vary the 4th and 9th-13th terms of the Zernike polynomials. We allow the focal surface curvature 
and focal surface to secondary distance L$_s$ to vary.  The primary-secondary distance L$_m$, primary offset $h$, 
and the primary and secondary rotation angles, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, are varied as well.  The optimization 
metric is the rms spot diameter across the field of view, with weighted constraints requiring telecentricity and 
maintaining the X- and Y-focal lengths.  We add Lagrange constraints 
to enforce beam clearances and place an upper limit on overall system size.  Once the optimization converges to 
an acceptable optical system, we add higher order Zernike terms, 19th-25th, and refine 
the mirror shapes using the same metric and constraints. 
The current PICO optical design is from this optimization procedure.

Figure~\ref{fig:compare} 
shows that the second optimization method reduces the overall telescope volume, allowing it to fit more easily within the shadow cone, 
and increases the DLFOV.  
The DLFOV increases by 1.9$\times$ at 21~GHz and by 4.6$\times$ at 799~GHZ, relative to the initial open-Dragone. 
%\comr{This is relative to which baseline? need to provide improvement relative to the same starting point, but also give improvement relative 
%to method1.}
The most important gain in the DLFOV is at 129 and 155~GHz where it increased by 3.8$\times$ and 4.3$\times$, respectively.  
This added area allows us to add `C' and `D' pixels, see Figure~\ref{fig:bands} and Section~\ref{sec:focalplane}, %\comr{what pixels? what is C, D?} 
%which are critical to meeting PICO's cosmology and fundamental physics science goals, because they
which contain the bands most sensitive to the CMB. Being able to 
pack 100's of `C' and `D' pixels into the focal plane is what allows PICO to reach unprecedented levels of CMB sensitivity. 
The first optimization method gives slightly worse performance at the lower frequencies with 92\% and 87\% the DLFOV relative to method two 
at 21 and 155~GHz, respectively.  Method two gives a smaller DLFOV at 799~GHz, only 30\% of the method one area, but the DLFOV is still sufficient 
for the number of 799~GHz detectors we require. 

 \comr{do you mean if we had only optimization method 1 we wouldn't reach our goals?} \como{not really, because the goals are poorly defined.  But total sensitivity would be lower with method 1 only.}

The geometric parameters of the PICO optical system are given in Table~\ref{tab:optics}. The 
system is diffraction limited for 799~GHz at the center of the field of view. At 155~GHz the 
DLFOV is 82.4~deg$^2$ and the total throughput for all frequencies is 910 cm$^2$sr. 
Figure~\ref{fig:strehl} shows Strehl of 0.8 contours for all pixel types.
The slightly concave focal surface, which has a radius of curvature of 4.55~m, is telecentric to 
within 0.12\dgr\ across the entire FOV.

The ray traces (left) are aligned at the chief ray impact point on the primary. 
The optimized system (red rays, solid mirrors) is smaller in the vertical direction than the unoptimized version 
(blue rays, dash-dot mirrors). The overlaid Strehl~$=0.8$ contours (right) show the improvement at 
all frequencies in the optimized (solid lines) system over the unoptimized (dash-dot lines) system. 
}
\end{figure} 

An additional benefit of the optimization is the concave focal surface. The open-Dragone's focal surface is naturally curved.  Matching this 
curvature reduces defocus and increases the DLFOV as well as increasing telecentricity.  The unoptimized system is telecentric to within 
2.5\dgr while the optimized version is telecentric to within 0.12\dgr. If the focal surface is too strongly curved tiling it with flat detector 
wafers would result in large defocus at the edges of these wafers.  This is not the case for PICO. The focal surface radius of curvature, 4.55~m, 
results in a defocus of 0.1~mm for the edge of a 10~cm wafer.

However, the sidelobe and direct 
sky view in the cross-Dragone system require a long forebaffle or large $F$-number to mitigate, both of which are problematic in the PICO case.

\section{FOCAL PLANE}
\label{sec:focalplane}

Modern mm/sub-mm detectors are photon noise limited, therefore the primary way to increase sensitivity is to increase the number of detectors. 
The PICO focal plane has 12,996 detectors, 175 times the number flown on \textit{Planck}. PICO achieves this by 
having a large DLFOV and using multichroic pixels (MCPs)\cite{Suzuki2014_samps,datta2014_mcp}. 
The MCP architecture assumed for PICO has three bands per pixel with two single polarization transition 
edge sensor (TES) bolometers bolometers per band and therefore six bolometers per pixel. 
We assume the MCPs are coupled to free space using lenslets and sinuous antennae \cite{Suzuki2014_samps}, 
however the pixel size, number, and spacing is 
relatively agnostic to the coupling scheme meaning the current layout would not change significantly 
if horn or phased array coupling was used instead.

PICO has 21 overlapping bands with centers spanning the range 21--799~GHz. The bands are divided amongst 
nine pixel types, A-I; see Figure~\ref{fig:bands}. 
%These bands provide the broad fequency coverage needed to seperate the CMB, Galactic dust, and various foregrounds using their differing spectra.  \comr{no. it is needed to achieve all of our science goals. separating foreground is only one of the goals of the broad frequency coverage.}
The 25\% fractional bandwidth is broader than the interband spacing causing neighboring bands to 
overlap and requiring them to be in separate pixels. 
%For example, bands 1, 3, and 5 are in pixel A while bands 2, 4, and 6 are in pixel B.  This 
%complicates the pixel design and focal plane layout, but allows broader bands which increases total sensitivity.  
%\comb{Be more succinct. A paper is not a tutorial. I don't agree that it leads to more complications}
The exceptions to the MCP architecture are the highest three bands, because they are above the superconducting 
band gap of niobium which is used for the transmission lines, antennae, and filters of the MCPs.  
For bands G, H, and I we will use feedhorn-coupled polarization sensitive bolometers similar to those used with 
\textit{Planck}\cite{planck2010_hfi} and Herschel SPIRE\cite{spire2010}.

\end{figure} 

Figure~\ref{fig:focal_plane} shows the PICO focal plane.  
We optimize the diameter of each MCP by calculating the array sensitivity for that pixel type. The calculation includes the 
increased illumination of the aperture stop as the pixel diameter decreases, as described in Section~\ref{sec:det_noise}.
We choose a pixel diameter of $2.1$F$\lambda_{mid}$, where $\lambda_{mid}$ refers to the center 
band of each pixel. This gives an edge taper, $T_e$, on the stop of 10~dB for the center band. 

%We hex-pack pixels onto 94~mm hexagonal wafers to minimize wasted space for the mid-frequency pixels. 
%The three central wafers have the same 94~mm hexagon footprint but are split into 
%3 rhombi, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:focal_plane}, because the highest frequency magenta wafer will use different 
%detector technology and will need to be fabricated separately.  \comb{I don't understand the last few sentences. Need to discuss}


%The 3 central wafers are rhombi to put the F pixels on different wafers than the G, H, and I pixels, which use different technology. The C and D/E wafers are 94~mm regular hexagons. 


% The PICO focal plane is designed to take maximum advantage of the large field of view.  The optical quality peaks at the 
% focal plane center and falls off with radius as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:strehl}.  This pattern dictates the layout shown 
% in Figure~\ref{fig:focal_plane}. The highest frequency pixels are centered on the focal plane and low frequency pixels are arranged 
% around the edge. The maximum radial distance for a given pixel is the point where 
% the Strehl ratio for the upper edge of the highest frequency band within that pixel equals 0.8.  Interior to these contours, the ellipses in 
% Figure~\ref{fig:focal_plane}, the Strehl ratio increases ensuring pixels are diffraction limited.
% \comb{most of the text in this paragraph is relatively trivial (including the first sentence). Can prune and make more succinct.}

\sout{Optimizing the pixel size is a balance between the total number of pixels, $N_{px}$, and the efficiency with which 
they couple to the telescope. Smaller pixels pack more densely on the focal plane, $N_{px}\propto 1/D_{px}^2$, but over

\comb{We optimize the pixels diameters for each MCP by calculating the mapping speed. The calculation includes the

% order 0.5 sec is longer than the sample time even at 1 deg beams. sweeping 1 deg takes 0.2 sec.
The polarization sensitive bolometers in each MCP are oriented perpendicular to each other. 
Differencing the bolometers allows each pixel to measure Stokes Q or, if the 
pixel is rotated by 45\dgr, Stokes U. We rotate neighboring pixels which scan over the same sky location by 45\dgr, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:QU}.
This layout reduces systematic errors by maximizing the number of Q,U pixel pairs which have almost identical optical paths and measure sky locations 
as close to simultaneously as possible.

Two multiplexing methods, time domain (TDM) and frequency domain (FDM), where explored 
for PICO. Trade-off details are discussed in Sutin et~al.\cite{brian_spie}
The current PICO baseline is TDM, but the choice is not a driver for the focal plane layout or noise discussed in this paper.



\section{INSTRUMENT NOISE}
\label{sec:noise}
%\comr{comment somewhere in this section that these noise numbers are CBE. no margins.}

We develop an end to end white noise model of the PICO instrument to predict full mission sensitivity and 
provide a metric by which to evaluate optical, mechanical, and mission design trade-offs.  This model does not include 
1/f noise or estimates of possible systematic effects.  %We assume TES bolometers read out using time domain multiplexing (TDM). 
%To simplify the model, we assume TES bolometers as the detector at all frequencies, even though other technologies may be better suited to the lowest bands.  
%Any suitable technology will be photon noise dominated as the TESs are, so total noise levels in the lowest bands should be relatively unaffected by 
%the use of a different detector technology.
To construct the model we follow the standard process\cite{suzuki2013_thesis,aubin2013_thesis} of estimating the 
optical load, calculating properties of the TES bolometers, calculating noise equivalent power (NEP) by source, 
combining all NEP terms to get detector noise, and finally combining all detectors to get full mission sensitivity.  
Each of these steps includes various assumptions and design decisions, 
which are discussed in this section.  The assumptions are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:assume}.

\subsection{Single bolometer noise}
\label{sec:det_noise}

\subsubsection{Model}

The sources of optical load are the CMB, primary and secondary mirrors, aperture stop, and a low pass optical filter.  These elements 
are shown schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:load}. 
%We assume the primary is 15~K, the stop 6and secondary 4~K, and the low pass filter 100~mK. % for details of the thermal design see \citenum{brian_spie}.  
%The emissivity of the mirrors depends on frequency, $\epsilon(\nu) =  \epsilon_0\sqrt{\nu / (\text{150~GHz})}$. At 150~GHz we assume an emissivity of 0.07\% 
%\cite{planck2011_hfi_temp,planck2018_lfi_mirrors}. 
%Emissivity of the stop and low pass filter was 1 at all frequencies.
%; temperatures and emissivities are given in Table~\ref{tab:noise_model}. 
%
The total load absorbed at the bolometer is the sum of the power emitted by each element reduced by the transmission efficiency of the elements between 
the emitting surface and the bolometer.  
%For example, the CMB power is reduced by the optical efficiency of the entire instrument, 
%$\eta_{opt} = \eta_{PRI}\eta_{stop}\eta_{SEC}\eta_{filter}\eta_{bolo}$, while the power emitted by the low pass filter is reduced only by $\eta_{bolo}$.
The absorbed power is,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:load}
P_{abs} =  (((( P_{CMB} \eta_{PRI} + P_{PRI} ) \eta_{stop} + P_{stop}(1-\eta_{stop}) ) \eta_{SEC} + P_{SEC})\eta_{filter} + P_{filter}) \eta_{bolo},
\end{equation} 
%_{i=Filter}^{CMB}
% maybe change PRI to M1, SEC to M2 ??
where $P_{elem}$ is the in band power emitted by a given element for a single polarization and $\eta_{elem}$ is the efficiency 
of the element. %We assumed 25\% fractional bandwidth top-hat bands and throughput of $\lambda^2$. 
Power emitted by the stop is a special case. We multiply $P_{stop}$ by 
$(1-\eta_{stop})$ because $\eta_{stop}$ is spillover efficiency, the fraction of the throughput which passes through the stop, therefore $(1-\eta_{stop})$ 
is the fraction of the throughput which views the stop.  

\begin{figure} [ht]

\caption[load] { \label{fig:load} 
Schematic representation of the prediction of optical load.  Power emitted by each element is modified by the efficiency of the following elements 
and added to the total expected load.  The multichroic pixel illuminates the stop differently for each of the three bands.
}
\end{figure} 
%

For PICO, the CMB and stop dominate the optical loading as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:popt}.  %at low frequencies while and mirror emission 
% stop is ~1/3 of the load for 0.68 bands. 
%is the majority above 460~GHz due to their differing temperatures, see Figure~\ref{fig:popt}. 
The jumps in load between neighboring bands, seen in Figure~\ref{fig:popt} around 70 and 200~GHz, are due to $\eta_{stop}$ changing with frequency 
which is a consequence of using MCPs.  
The MCP angular beam width is dependent on the wavelength and pixel diameter as,\cite{suzuki2013_thesis}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mcp_beam}
\theta_{1/e^2} = \frac{2.95 \lambda}{\pi D_{px}}. 
\end{equation} 
The edge taper, T$_e$, of the middle frequency band in each pixel is chosen to be 10~dB. For the upper and lower bands T$_e$ is calculated using 
Equation~\ref{eq:mcp_beam}. This changing illumination of the stop is shown schematically by the dashed rays in Figure~\ref{fig:load}. 
For each MCP, A-H, T$_e$ is 4.8, 10, and 20.7~dB for the lower, middle, and upper bands, respectively.  These 
edge tapers correspond to $\eta_{stop}$ of 0.68, 0.90, and 0.99.
% meaning 32\% of the lowest band's throughput couples to the cold stop while only 1\% of the high frequency band's throughput copules to the stop.  
The changing $\eta_{stop}$ has three main effects; uneven optical load between bands, varying NEP to noise equivalent temperature (NET) conversion 
between bands, and telescope beam size not scaling smoothly with $\lambda$.

%From $P_{abs}$ we calculate the TES bolometer properties for each band.  
%We assume a safety factor of 2, $P_{sat}/P_{abs}=2$; $P_{sat}$ is the 
%saturation power of the bolometer.  The PICO focal plane temperature, $T_o$, of 100~mK sets an optimal superconducting transition temperature, 
%$T_c$, of 187~mK.  We assume thermal conductivity scales as a power law, $G \propto T^n$,  with $n=2$.  The required thermal conductivity for 
%a given bolometer is set by the $P_{sat}$,
%any need to cite power law, G \propto T^n, assumption?

%\comr{need to say anything about C? tau? no real effect for FDM. if tau too long does matter for TDM. need to look in more detail. Roger assumed C = 1 pJ/K }

We consider four noise sources per bolometer; photon, phonon, TES Johnson, and readout. 
Photon noise depends on the absorbed power\cite{richards1994}, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:photon}
NEP_{\gamma}^2 = \int\limits_{band} 2h\nu p_{\nu} \, d\nu + 2\xi \int\limits_{band} p_{\nu}^2 \,  d\nu,
\end{equation} 
where $p_{\nu}$ is the power spectral density for a single polarization absorbed at the bolometer and $\xi$ is the fraction of correlated Bose 
photon noise. The factor of 2 in the Bose noise term is because we use single polarization bolometers.  
%
%
From $P_{abs}$ we calculate the TES bolometer properties and phonon noise.\cite{mather1982}  
%The second largest noise term is phonon noise\cite{mather1982} in the thermal connection to $T_o$,
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:phonon}
%NEP_{phonon}^2 = 4 \gamma k_b T_c^2 G,
%\end{equation} 
%where $\gamma$ is a unitless factor depending on $T_o$, $T_c$, and $n$. For PICO $\gamma=0.5$.
The last noise term intrinsic to the bolometer is the TES Johnson noise. All noise sources in the cold and warm readout 
electronics are lumped under the readout term.  The NEP for each noise source is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:noise}.

%NEP_{readout}^2 &\propto V_{bias}^2 \propto  P_{e}, \text{ and}\\
%P_{e} &= P_{sat} - P_{abs}.
%\end{gather}
%\end{split}

%This neglects the details of our readout noise models, but is an illustrative approximation usefull for this paper.

\subsubsection{Results}  % not the best word to distinguish these two subsubsections.

%  RESULTS
For PICO, photon noise dominates at all frequencies as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:noise}. Bose noise is most significant 
at lower frequencies with NEP$_{Bose}$/NEP$_{Poisson}= 1.5 $ in the lowest band.  However, since Poisson noise increases as 
$\sqrt{\nu}$ it equalls Bose noise at 30~GHz and dominates at higher bands; NEP$_{Bose}$/NEP$_{Poisson} <10\%$ at 321~GHz. 
% this is NEP/NEP NOT squared.  Squared is 2.2 at 21 GHz and 0.01 at 321. < 10 at 129 GHz.  in NEP to NEP bose = poisson at 30 GHz
Phonon noise is the second most significant source, NEP$_{phonon}$/NEP$_{photon}$ ranges from 65\% at 21~GHz 
to 19\% at 799~GHz. 

For TDM readout, phonon and readout noise are roughly equal with TES Johnson noise being insignificant.  We also modeled 
FDM readout.  For FDM the TES Johnson noise is higher, 2/3 of the readout NEP, but the readout 
noise is lower.  Comparing the combinined TES Johnson and readout NEPs for TDM and FDM we find essentially indentical performance 
with total noise differing by less than 3\% across all bands.  For both systems we require a focal plane temperature, $T_o$, of 
100~mK and a bolometer safety factor of 2 to remain photon noise dominated at the lowest bands.

The primary driver of noise levels is the optical load.  The combination of the CMB and aperture stop make up the majority of the load in all bands.
The load from the mirrors is greatest at 799~GHz where it is 90\% of that from the CMB and stop. The CMB provides more than half the load 
in the middle and upper bands of the multichroic pixels, but the stop dominates the load in the lowest band of each pixel.  Load from the 
stop in the lowest band of each pixel ranges from 1.2$\times$ the CMB load at 21~GHz to a maximum of 4.7$\times$ the CMB load at 223~GHz. 
%Two options to mitigate this extra load are a colder stop or more aggresive edge taper.


% RESULTS 
% Readout noise depends on the assumption of FDM or TDM readout and includes all remaining noise sources, the Johnson noise of the TES as well as 
% all components not intrinsic to the bolometers.  
% For both multiplexing schemes NEP$_{readout}$ is dominated by the SQUID amplifier with moderate contributions from various resistors

\subsection{Combined  array noise}

Using single detector NEPs from Section~\ref{sec:det_noise} and the detector counts from Section~\ref{sec:focalplane} we 
calculate the combined NEP of the detector array for each band.  Combining detectors simply reduces noise by $\sqrt{N}$ 
except for Bose photon noise. For the lowest band of each MCP the pixels over sample the PSF, pixel spacing is $0.4$F$\lambda$, resulting in correlated 
Bose noise between pixels.  Accounting for this effect gives a 26\% increase in the combined array $NEP$ of the lowest band, 21~GHz, and  
a 0.003\% increase in array $NEP$ at the highest band, 799~GHz.  

From the array $NEP$ we convert to $NET$ per band,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:NET}
NET = \frac{NEP}{\sqrt{2} \, \eta_{opt} \int\limits_{band}\frac{dp_{\nu}}{dT}\Bigr|_{T_{CMB}} d\nu }.
\end{equation} 
The $\eta_{opt}$ term contributes to the `jumps' in $NET$ seen in Figure~\ref{fig:net}, because $\eta_{opt}$ varies band to band.  
%We use CMB temperature units for all bands, even though this isn't particularly suitable for the highest bands, because the CMB is the most stringent requirement on sensitivity.

All the above calculations are for sensitivity to temperature and are given in Table~\ref{tab:noise}.  Assuming evenly weighted observations 
of the full sky and 5 years observing at 95\% efficiency, we calculate full mission map sensitivities in polarization; final column in Table~\ref{tab:noise}.
Combining all bands gives a total CMB map depth for the entire PICO mission of 0.62~$\mu$K$_{CMB}$-arcmin.

\section{CONCLUSIONS/SUMMARY}

The PICO optical system is a simple two mirror open-Dragone which we numerically optimize to maximize the DLFOV.  The addition of a 
cold aperture stop and cold mirrors minimize optical load and reduce noise.  The focal plane takes advantage of the large DLFOV and MCP 
technology to implement 12996 polarization sensitive detectors in 21 bands from 21-799~GHz.  When combining all bands, our instrument 
noise model predicts full mission polarization map depth of 0.62~$\mu$K$_{CMB}$-arcmin.
