The Probe of Inflation and Cosmic Origins (PICO) is a probe-class mission concept currently under study by NASA.  
PICO will probe the physics of the Big Bang and the energy scale of inflation, constrain the sum of neutrino masses, 
measure the growth of structure in the universe, and constrain its reionization history by making full sky maps of the 
cosmic microwave background with sensitivity 70 times higher than the Planck space mission. With bands at 
21-799~GHz and arcmin resolution at the highest frequencies, PICO will make polarization maps of galactic synchrotron 
and dust emission to observe the role of Galactic magnetic fields in galactic evolution and star formation. 
We describe the current state of the PICO instrument design.  We discuss the choice of optical system, which is based on 
an open-Dragone telescope that, to our knowledge, has not been used for mm-wave astrophysical observations. 
We also present the focal plane design, a white noise model of the instrument, and the expected noise level.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:intro}  


\sout{Currently, NASA funded spaces missions in astronomy and astrophysics are either Explorer missions with \$250M cost caps or 
flagship missions, such as JWST, which cost roughly \$3-\$5B. }
Over the last decade NASA's astrophysics division has funded design and construction of space missions that are either Explorer-class, 
with cost cap of $\leq \$250$M or Flagship-class that cost above \$1B. 
To study the science opportunities available at intermediate costs, NASA initiated studies of Probe-class missions \comb{with cost window 
between \$400M and \$1B}.  We are conducting \comb{one these studies for a mission called The Probe of Inflation and Cosmic Origins. 
A paper by Sutin etal. in these proceedings gives an overall review of PICO and gives the scientific motivation. } 
\comr{include proper reference}
This paper describes the \sout{status of the instrument} \comb{design of the telescope and focal plane and gives 
our current best estimate for the sensitivity of the instrument.} The mission study is not complete; the final report 
is due in December 2018. Therefore, the quantitative assessments  we provide are temporary in nature and may change somewhat. 
Even so, the design is fairly mature and we don't expect significant changes. 
Values in this paper, such as component temperatures and detector noise levels,  
are current best estimates. They are not finalized mission requirements. 

\sout{Astrophysical observations in the  millimeter and sub-millimeter region of the electromagnetic spectrum contain a wealth of 
information about the formation, evolution, and structure of the Universe.  
The polarization and temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave 
background (CMB) encode fundamental physics information relating to the epoch of inflation, the mass of neutrinos,  
and the number of relic light particles in the early Universe. They also contain information about the formation of 
the first stars, galaxies, and clusters, as well as information on emission from the innermost regions of radio source jets.
Information about the role of magnetic fields in star formation and galactic evolution is obtainable 
by observing the polarized emission of Galactic dust, which 
traces magnetic fields, at high resolution. Targeting both of these regimes, PICO will survey the entire sky with 
unprecedented polarization sensitivity 
in 21 bands centered at 21--799~GHz.  Details of these science targets and expected constraints from PICO 
are in a companion paper, Sutin~et~al.\cite{brian_spie} 
In this paper we discuss the mission's optical system, focal plane, and sensitivity.}


%\comb{old: Large scale cosmological and fundamental 
%physics information, such as 
%evidence of inflation, the effect of the first stars and galaxies, constraints on neutrino masses, and limits on light particles beyond 
%the standard model, is contained in the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave 
%background (CMB). } 

\section{MISSION AND SPACECRAFT}
\label{sec:spacecraft}

%  This could all be in the intro instead. Purpose is to show constraints on the optics to motivate decisions discussed later.  
\comr{Change all 'mirrors' to reflectors} 

PICO will conduct scientific observations for five years from an orbit around the Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point. It has
21 bands centered at 21--799~GHz.  The spacecraft design impacts 
the optical design and sensitivity in two primary ways; volume constraints limit the physical size of the telescope and optical component 
temperatures impact noise levels.  

The maximum \sout{size} diameter of the spacecraft is limited by the SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch vehicle, which carries payloads up to 4.6~m in diameter. 
This diameter limits the V-groove \comb{shields'} size, which, along with the scan strategy, defines the `shadow cone' in Figure~\ref{fig:cad}.  
The shadow cone is the volume protected from solar illumination, and all optical components must remain within it. The shadow cone and 
inner V-grooves define an available volume for the telescope.  \comb{We opted not to use a deployable shield as it presented added costs 
and risk that outweighed its benefits.} The \comb{current thermal model indicates the temperatures of the optical elements as given in Figure~\ref{fig:cad}}. 
\comb{The primary reflector is passively cooled, while the optics box, secondary mirror, and focal plane are actively cooled; Sutin~et~al.\cite{brian_spie}
gives more details of the thermal system.}

\section{OPTICAL SYSTEM}
\label{sec:optics}

\sout{The PICO telescope is a 1.4~m aperture modified open-Dragone }.  The choice of telescope design was driven by a combination of science
requirements and the physical limits discussed in Section~\ref{sec:spacecraft}.  The science requirements are: a large diffraction 
limited field of view (DLFOV)\footnote{ We consider an area in the FOV diffraction limited when the Strehl ratio is 
larger than 0.8.} sufficient to support $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ detectors, arcminute resolution at 800~GHz, low 
instrumental polarization, and low sidelobe response. Additionally, 
the transition edge sensor bolometers baselined for PICO require a telecentric focal plane which is sufficiently flat that it 
can be tiled by 10~cm detector wafers without reduction in optical quality. 

\comb{To increase aperture efficiency and reduce sidelobes we concentrated on off-axis optical designs.}
More than 30 years ago Dragone analyzed the 
performance of several off-axis systems and found solutions with low cross-polarization at the center of the field 
of view and with astigmatism, or astigmatism and coma, canceled to first order.\cite{dragone,dragone_coma,dragone1983} These
systems also had no cross-polarization at the center of the field of view. 
A number of recent CMB instruments used off-axis systems, and several 
began the design optimization with systems based on designs by
Dragone\cite{planck2000_optics,ACT2011_optics,SPT2008_optics,core2018_inst,LB2016_optics,parshley_ccat_spie}. 
For PICO we began \sout{begin} \comr{ present tense? I suggest it all becomes past tense.} 
the optimization with a \comb{two-reflector} Dragone system that to our knowledge has not been implemented in CMB instruments before. 
We call it an `open-Dragone' because of its overall geometry and in contrast to the widely used `cross-Dragone', see Figure~\ref{fig:ray}. 
\comb{We used a 1.4~m entrance aperture as this aperture diameter satisfied the science requirements.} \comr{note unresolved references}

%\comr{I am confused about the previous paragraph. It starts with a claim of a quantitative 'comparison' between a number of 
%systems; it even presents the advantages of a particular figure of merit, but in the
%end it is largely a set of qualitative arguments.  Here is my version of this paragraph. }
%\como{I agree the rewritten strucutre is better.  I refined it some more.}

We consider \comr{past tense please} two additional Dragone systems, a Gregorian Dragone and a cross-Dragone, and compare the 
relative performance of all three systems in terms of DLFOV, compactness, and rejection of sidelobes.  
Compared to the open-Dragone, the Gregorian has half the DLFOV for the same $F$-number and cannot  
support $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ detectors. It is therefore rejected.  
The cross-Dragone has roughly $4\times$ the DLFOV of the open-Dragone, 
but is more difficult to pack inside the spacecraft volume while avoiding the known sidelobes shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sidelobes}.
We find that the largest cross-Dragone which meets the PICO volume constraints has 
a 1.2~m aperture and an $F$-number of 2.5, while the largest open-Dragone aperture is 1.4~m with an $F$-number of 1.42. The larger 
$F$-number of the cross-Dragone system implies a larger physical focal plane, and therefore higher mass and cost, 
for the same number of pixels. 
%Although the 1.2~m cross-Dragone can accommodate a larger DLFOV, we could not mitigate
%its sidelobes without further reducing the aperture. 
For the PICO case, we conclude that the advantages of a low $F$-number and easily baffled sidelobes make the open-Dragone a good starting  
point for further optimization. 


%A cross-Dragone will always have a larger $F$-number 
%than an open-Dragone of the same aperture size, because the cross-Dragone focal length must be long enough that the focal plane 
%does not block the primary mirror. } 
% \comr{Can you really make such a general claim? }
%\comr{why does it 'always' have larger F? Can make a smaller F, no?}. \como{The smallest $F$-number of a crossed system is about 2. The focal length has to be long so the focal plane doesn't block the primary. You could make an open with F > 2, but you can't make a crossed system with F < 2.}

Comparison of sidelobes for a cross-Dragone (left) and an open-Dragone (right) \comr{please add labels to Figure as well}.  
Rays are traced from the center of the focal plane toward the sky \comr{same angular opening of rays?}.
For both systems spillover around the secondary is straightforward to mitigate with absorptive baffles \comr{show sketch of such baffles?}.  
However, the \comb{rays labeled} `sidelobe' and `direct view to 
sky' in the cross-Dragone system \comb{present added challenges. The challenges can be mitigated - with a long forebaffle or larger $F$-number (see
for example \comr{add LB reference}) - but
increase the overall physical size of the system,} which is problematic in the PICO case.}
\end{figure} 

We design \comr{past tense} the initial open Dragone following Granet's method\cite{granet2001}. 
\comr{note tweak to the way this is presented} 
We began with a solution with $F=1.42$, 1.4~m aperture (that was verified to satisfy the volume constraints), and a large 
DLFOV.  We force a circular aperture stop 
between the primary and secondary mirrors and numerically optimize its angle and position to obtain the best 
optical performance \comr{what does that mean? do you mean the largest DLFOV?}.  The stop diameter provides an 
effective 1.4~m aperture on the primary for the center feed. \comr{need to clarify} 
Adding a stop in this way increases the size of the primary \comb{reflector}, because \sout{the primary is unevenly illuminated at various 
field angles.} different field angles illuminate different areas on the reflector.
Actively cooling the aperture stop, however, reduces detector noise, and the stop shields the 
focal plane from stray radiation. At this stage the system still meets 
the Dragone condition and is defined by the `Initial Open-Dragone' parameters in Table~\ref{tab:optics}.

In his publications Dragone provides a prescription to eliminate coma
in addition to the cancellation of astigmatism in the baseline designs.\cite{dragone_coma} The corrections 
involve adding distortions to the primary and secondary reflectors 
which are proportional to $r^4$ where $r=0$ is at the chief ray impact point on each reflector. 
We thus attempt to increase the DLFOV using two methods. 

In \comb{ `Method1'}, one of the coauthors (RH) used Zemax to add Zernike 
polynomials to the base conics which describe the mirrors. These Zernike polynomials are offset from the symmetry axis of the conic 
by $624.2$~cm for the primary and $76.1$~cm for the secondary.  
This places the origin of polynomials at the chief ray impact point for each mirror. 
Inspired by the Dragone corrections, all Zernike terms up to fourth order and the first fifth order term are allowed to vary. 
The optimization metric is minimization of the rms spot diameter at 
the following locations: the center of the FOV, $\pm2$~deg in Y, and $\pm4$~deg in X. The center of the FOV is given a weight of 100
while each outer point is given a weight of 1. To constrain the optimization, the X and Y 
effective focal lengths are held fixed as is the impact point of the chief ray on the focal plane. 
This optimization step increases the DLFOV
by factors of 1.15, 2.4 and 10.5 at 21, 155 and 799~GHz, respectively. 
We \comr{further?} improve the DLFOV at all frequencies by approximately 50\% by rerunning the optimization and including 
a curved focal surface. A small ($\sim$4\%) additional gain in DLFOV is achieved by adding Zernike terms 
up to sixth order, allowing the secondary to focal surface distance to vary, adding a weighted constraint on the effective focal length, 
and adding fields with weight of 0.01 to the rms spot diameter metric at $\pm7.5$~deg in Y and $+15$~deg in X. 
These additional fields are necessary to constrain the corrections at the mirror edges.

% \comr{The other method by Richard has the first step of converting the conics into an on axis XY polynomial representation. Then a similar procedure is followed.  It is less well behaved during optimization.  This second Richard method is what I replicated in CodeV.}
% \comb{is this 'other method' = method2? or is it 1b? \como{KY: My method is 1b and not discussed here.}}

and the primary and secondary rotation angles, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, are varied as well.  The optimization 
metric is the rms spot diameter across the field of view, with weighted constraints requiring telecentricity and 
maintaining the X- and Y-focal lengths.  We add Lagrange constraints 
to enforce beam clearances and place an upper limit on overall system size.  Once the optimization converges to 
an acceptable optical system, we add higher order Zernike terms, 19th-25th, and refine 
the mirror shapes using the same metric and constraints. 
The current PICO optical design is from the \comb{Method2} optimization procedure.

Figure~\ref{fig:compare} shows that Method2 greatly increases \comr{present tense} the DLFOV relative to the initial open-Dragone design.  
The DLFOV is increased \comr{past tense} by factors of 1.9, 3.8, 4.3, and 4.6 at 21, 129, 155, and 799~GHz, respectively.  
%\comr{what is the improvement relative to the RH approach?}
The most important gain is \comb{at frequencies of }129 and 155~GHz \comb{for which we use the extra area} to add 
\sout{many} more C and D pixels, see Figure~\ref{fig:bands} and Section~\ref{sec:focalplane}. \comb{These are the bands 
that are} most sensitive to the CMB. 
\sout{Being able to pack} Adding \sout{100s} hundreds of C and D pixels into the focal plane \sout{is what allows} 
\comb{gives} PICO \sout{to reach}  unprecedented levels of CMB sensitivity. 
\comr{one word replaced 5 (always a good thing). What is allowed or not allowed is not interesting. Write on what you do or have.}
Compared to Method1 \sout{the first optimization method, the second} Method2 gives a somewhat better performance at the lower 
frequencies with 1.11 and 1.15 times larger DLFOV at 21 and 155~GHz, respectively.
Method2 gives a smaller DLFOV at 799~GHz, only 0.3 times that of Method1's area, but the DLFOV still satisfies our science 
requirements. \sout{sufficient for the number of 799~GHz detectors we require}. 
Figure~\ref{fig:compare} also shows \comb{that} with Method2 the overall telescope volume \comb{is reduced, giving more 
physical margin relative to the shadow cone.} 
\sout{allowing it to fit more easily within the shadow cone. }

The geometric parameters of the PICO optical system are given in Table~\ref{tab:optics}. The 
system is diffraction limited for 799~GHz at the center of the field of view. At 155~GHz the 
DLFOV is 82.4~deg$^2$ and the total throughput for all frequencies \comr{?? you really mean at 20 GHz, no?} is 910 cm$^2$sr. 
Figure~\ref{fig:strehl} shows Strehl of 0.8 contours for all pixel types.
The slightly concave focal surface, which has a radius of curvature of 4.55~m, is telecentric to 
within 0.12~deg across the entire FOV.

(right) show the improvement at all frequencies in the optimized (solid lines) system over the unoptimized (dash-dot lines) system.

\end{figure} 

An additional benefit of the optimization is the concave focal surface. The open-Dragone's focal surface is naturally curved.  Matching this 
curvature reduces defocus and increases the DLFOV as well as increasing telecentricity.  The unoptimized system is telecentric to within 
2.5~deg while the optimized version is telecentric to within 0.12~deg. If the focal surface is too strongly curved tiling it with flat detector 
wafers would result in large defocus at the edges of these wafers.  This is not the case for PICO. The focal surface radius of curvature, 4.55~m, 
results in a defocus of 0.1~mm for the edge of a 10~cm wafer. 



\section{FOCAL PLANE}
\label{sec:focalplane}

Modern mm/sub-mm \comb{bolometers are photon noise limited. An 
effective way to increase sensitivity is to increase the number of detectors in the focal surface}. 
The PICO focal \sout{plane} surface has 12,996 detectors, 175 times the number flown on \textit{Planck}. PICO achieves this by 
having a large DLFOV and using multichroic pixels (MCPs)\cite{Suzuki2014_samps,datta2014_mcp}. 
The MCP architecture assumed for PICO has three bands per pixel with two single polarization transition 
edge sensor (TES) bolometers per band and therefore six bolometers per pixel. 
We assume the MCPs are coupled to free space using lenslets and sinuous antennae \cite{Suzuki2014_samps}, 
but the focal plane layout, including pixel sizes, numbers, and spacing would not change significantly 
if horn or phased array coupling was used instead.

PICO has 21 overlapping bands with centers spanning the range 21--799~GHz. The bands are divided amongst 
nine pixel types labeled A to I; see Figure~\ref{fig:bands}. 
%These bands provide the broad fequency coverage needed to seperate the CMB, Galactic dust, and various foregrounds using their differing spectra.  \comr{no. it is needed to achieve all of our science goals. separating foreground is only one of the goals of the broad frequency coverage.}
The 25\% fractional bandwidth is broader than the interband spacing causing neighboring bands to 
overlap and requiring them to be in separate pixels. 
%For example, bands 1, 3, and 5 are in pixel A while bands 2, 4, and 6 are in pixel B.  This 
%complicates the pixel design and focal plane layout, but allows broader bands which increases total sensitivity.  
%\comb{Be more succinct. A paper is not a tutorial. I don't agree that it leads to more complications}
The exceptions to the MCP architecture are the highest three bands, because they are above the superconducting 
band gap of niobium which is used for the transmission lines, antennae, and filters of the MCPs.  
For bands G, H, and I, we will use feedhorn-coupled polarization sensitive bolometers. The technology has high TRL 
as it has already been used successfully with 
\textit{Planck}\cite{planck2010_hfi} and Herschel SPIRE\cite{spire2010}.

single color pixels G, H, and I.}
\end{figure} 

Figure~\ref{fig:focal_plane} shows the PICO focal plane.  
We optimize the diameter of each MCP by calculating the array sensitivity for that pixel type. The calculation includes the 
increased illumination of the aperture stop as the pixel diameter decreases, as described in Section~\ref{sec:det_noise}.
We choose a pixel diameter of $2.1$F$\lambda_{\rm mid}$, where $\lambda_{\rm mid}$ refers to the center 
band of each pixel. This gives an edge taper, $T_e$, on the stop of 10~dB for the center band of each pixel.

\end{figure} 

Differencing detectors that are sensitive to orthogonal polarization states enables each pixel to make a measurement of 
a particular Stokes parameter. Pixels that are sensitive to the $U$ Stokes parameter are rotated by 45~deg relative to those
that are sensitive to $Q$. This Q/U measurement is in the instrument reference frame with the $x$-axis parallel to the scan 
direction; see Figure~\ref{fig:QU}.  \comr{combine Figures 6 and 7 together?}

The PICO focal plane readout has been designed around $\times$128 time domain multiplexing (TDM), but this choice is not a 
significant driver for the focal plane layout or overall noise budget. 

\section{INSTRUMENT NOISE}
\label{sec:noise}

We develop \comr{past tense here and throughout please} an end to end noise model of the PICO instrument to predict full mission sensitivity and 
provide a metric by which to evaluate mission design trade-offs.  This model assumes white noise
at all frequencies. The overall sensitivity does not include calibration uncertainties or estimates of other possible 
systematic effects. To construct the model we estimate the 
optical load, calculate noise equivalent power (NEP) by source, 
combine all NEP terms to get detector noise, combine all detectors to get noise per frequency band, and then 
include total mission time to find overall mission sensitivity.\cite{suzuki2013_thesis,aubin2013_thesis}  
Each of these steps includes various assumptions and design decisions, 
which are discussed in this section.  The assumptions are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:assume}.
\comb{The values presented here are our current best case estimates. Instrument noise {\it requirements}, which would have larger 
noise levels, are still being determined.}

To validate our model we \comb{compared two independent calculations using codes that were used for several earlier
CMB instruments}.  The calculations agree within 1\% for individual noise terms 
and for overall mission noise.  We also use our model to calculate CORE and LiteBIRD noise using their published system parameters. The 
results are consistent with published values when similar assumptions are used.  \comr{move these to later; let's talk on the phone} Additionally, 
we compare PICO detector noise to CORE and LiteBIRD detector noise.  The lower PICO noise is explained by the cold system and differing 
optical efficiency.  From these test we conclude that our model is correct and our assumptions are reasonable.

\subsection{Single bolometer noise}
\label{sec:det_noise}

\subsubsection{Model}

The sources of optical load are the CMB, the primary and secondary mirrors, the aperture stop, and low pass filters.  
These elements are shown schematically in Figure~\ref{fig:load}. 
The total load absorbed at the bolometer is the sum of the power emitted by each element reduced by the transmission 
efficiency of the elements between the emitting surface and the bolometer.  
The absorbed power is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:load}
P_{\rm abs} =  (((( P_{\rm CMB} \eta_{\rm PRI} + P_{\rm PRI} ) \eta_{\rm stop} + P_{\rm stop}(1-\eta_{\rm stop}) ) \eta_{\rm SEC} + P_{\rm SEC})\eta_{\rm filter} + P_{\rm filter}) \eta_{\rm bolo},
\end{equation} 
where $P_{\rm elem}$ is the in band power emitted by a given element for a single polarization and $\eta_{\rm elem}$ is the 
transmission efficiency 
of the element. Power emitted by the stop is a special case. We multiply $P_{\rm stop}$ by 
$(1-\eta_{\rm stop})$ because $\eta_{\rm stop}$ is the spillover efficiency, the fraction of the throughput which passes through the 
stop. Therefore $(1-\eta_{\rm stop})$ is the fraction of the throughput which views the stop. \comb{We determine 
$\eta_{\rm stop}$ in the following way. }
The MCP angular beam width depends on the wavelength and pixel diameter as\cite{suzuki2013_thesis}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mcp_beam}
\theta_{1/e^2} = \frac{2.95 \lambda}{\pi D_{\rm px}}. 
\end{equation} 
\comr{please check} We fix $D_{\rm px}$ such that 
the edge taper T$_e$ of the middle frequency band in each pixel is 10~dB and calculate T$_e$ for the upper and lower bands 
using Equation~\ref{eq:mcp_beam}. This changing illumination of the stop is shown schematically by 
the dashed rays in Figure~\ref{fig:load}. 
For each MCP in pixels A-H T$_e$ is 4.8, 10, and 20.7~dB for the lower, middle, and upper bands, respectively.  These 
edge tapers correspond to $\eta_{\rm stop}$ of 0.68, 0.90, and 0.99.
The changing $\eta_{\rm stop}$ has two main effects; changing optical efficiency between bands, which affects optical load 
and the NEP to noise equivalent temperature (NET) conversion, and telescope beam size not scaling smoothly with $\lambda$.
\comb{The left panel of Figure~\ref{fig:popt} gives the optical load as a function of frequency. The jumps in load between 
neighboring bands near 70 and 200~GHz, are 
due to $\eta_{\rm stop}$ changing with frequency, \comr{comma was missing. I believe that in most cases a comma precedes `which'} 
which is a consequence of using MCPs.  }

}
\end{figure} 

We consider four noise sources per bolometer; photon, phonon, TES Johnson, and readout. 
Photon noise depends on the absorbed power\cite{richards1994}, 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:photon}
NEP_{\gamma}^2 = \int\limits_{\rm band} 2h\nu p_{\nu} \, d\nu + 2\xi \int\limits_{\rm band} p_{\nu}^2 \,  d\nu,
\end{equation} 
where $p_{\nu}$ is the power spectral density for a single polarization absorbed at the bolometer and $\xi=1$ is the fraction of correlated Bose 
photon noise. We include a factor of 2 in the Bose noise term because the bolometers receive the power from a single 
polarization. 
From $P_{\rm abs}$ we calculate the TES bolometer properties and phonon noise.\cite{mather1982}  
We calculate TES Johnson noise, which depends on bolometer bias parameters, for each frequency band.  
All noise sources in the cold and warm readout electronics are lumped under the readout term.  The \comb{combined NEP and for each} noise source as a function 
of frequency are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:noise}; the \comb{combined value is given in Table~\ref{tab:noise}.} \comr{did you even define the term NEP?}

\subsubsection{Results}  % not the best word to distinguish these two subsubsections.

\sout{For PICO} The primary \comb{contributor to noise}  is the optical load.  The CMB and stop account for the majority of the optical load 
at all frequencies. Even at 800~GHz the CMB and stop
account for 12\% more power than the mirrors;  \comr{show components in the Figure?} \comb{see the left panel 
of Figure~\ref{fig:popt}.}
\comr{is the following consistent with the previous sentence?} The load from the mirrors is greatest at 799~GHz where it is 47\% of the total 
optical load. The CMB provides more than half the load 
in the middle and upper bands of the multichroic pixels, but the stop dominates the load in the lowest band of each pixel.  
Load from the stop in the lowest band of each pixel ranges from 1.2 times the CMB load at 21~GHz to a maximum of 4.7 
times the CMB load at 223~GHz. \comr{did we consider two bands per pixel? }

Bose noise is most significant 
at lower frequencies with NEP$_{\rm Bose}$/NEP$_{\rm Poisson}= 1.5 $ in the lowest band. (\comb{All NEP ratios are calculated using 
units of W/$\sqrt{\mbox{Hz}}$ for the dividend and divisor.}\comr{check})   However, Poisson noise increases as 
$\sqrt{P_{\rm abs}\nu}$ while Bose is proportional to $P_{\rm abs}$. The Poisson noise equals Bose noise at 30~GHz and dominates at higher bands; 
NEP$_{\rm Bose}$/NEP$_{\rm Poisson} <10\%$ at 321~GHz. 
Phonon noise is the second most significant source, NEP$_{\rm phonon}$/NEP$_{\rm photon}$ ranges from 65\% at 21~GHz 
to 19\% at 799~GHz. 
% this is NEP/NEP NOT squared.  Squared is 2.2 at 21 GHz and 0.01 at 321. < 10 at 129 GHz.  in NEP to NEP bose = poisson at 30 GHz

For TDM readout, phonon and readout noise are \sout{roughly} approximately equal with TES Johnson noise being insignificant.  We also modeled 
\comb{noise} for frequency domain multiplexing readout (FDM).  For FDM the TES Johnson noise is higher, 2/3 of the readout NEP, but the readout 
noise is lower.  Comparing the combined TES Johnson and readout NEPs for TDM and FDM we find essentially identical performance 
with total noise differing by less than 3\% across all bands.  For both systems we require a focal plane temperature, $T_o$, of 
100~mK and a bolometer safety factor of 2 to remain photon noise dominated at the lowest bands. \comr{what does this mean? that 
if the safety factor is higher we are not photon noise dominated?} 
%\comr{should we have Dobbs review this?} \como{I don't think it is necessary. But you're more familiar with the politics of this one. Dobbs isn't a co-author, if that matters.}

\subsection{Combined  array noise}

Using single detector NEPs from Section~\ref{sec:det_noise} and the detector counts from Section~\ref{sec:focalplane} we 
calculate the combined NEP of the detector array for each band.  Combining detectors simply reduces noise by $\sqrt{N}$ 
except for Bose photon noise. \sout{For the lowest band of each MCP the pixels over sample the PSF, 
pixel spacing is $0.4$F$\lambda$, resulting in correlated 
Bose noise between pixels.} \comr{have you defined psf? spell out. Also please avoid this style: fragment, explaining the fragment, fragment.}  
\comb{For the lowest band of each MCP the pixel spacing is $0.4$F$\lambda$  and thus the pixels oversample the point spread function leading 
to correlated photon noise between pixels.}
Accounting for this effect gives a 26\% increase in the combined array $NEP$ \comb{for the 21~GHz band} \sout{of the lowest frequency band, 21~GHz,} 
\comr{fragment, explain, fragment} and  
a 0.003\% increase \sout{in array $NEP$} at \sout{the highest band,} 799~GHz.  

From the array $NEP$ we convert to \comb{noise equivalent temperature} $NET$ per band\sout{,} \comb{using}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:NET}
\frac{NEP}{NET} = \sqrt{2} \, \eta_{\rm opt} \int\limits_{\rm band}\frac{dp_{\nu}}{dT}\Bigr|_{T_{\rm CMB}} d\nu.
\end{equation} 
The $\eta_{\rm opt}$ term contributes to the `jumps' in $NET$ seen in Figure~\ref{fig:net}, because $\eta_{\rm opt}$ varies band to band.  
\comb{Numerical values for the NET are given in the second to last column in Table~\ref{tab:noise}}.

Assuming evenly weighted observations 
of the full sky, 5 years of mission duration, and 95\% efficiency, we calculate full mission map sensitivities in polarization; \comb{see the } 
final column in Table~\ref{tab:noise}. \comr{Karl, please don't replace words with punctuation marks. Use sentences with words.} 
Combining all bands gives a total CMB map depth for the entire PICO mission of 0.62~$\mu$K$_{\rm CMB}$-arcmin.

\section{CONCLUSIONS/SUMMARY}

The PICO optical system is a simple two mirror open-Dragone which we numerically optimize to maximize the DLFOV.  The addition of a 
cold aperture stop and cold mirrors minimize optical load and reduce noise.  The focal plane takes advantage of the large DLFOV and MCP 
technology to implement 12996 polarization sensitive detectors in 21 bands from 21-799~GHz.  When combining all bands, our instrument 
noise model predicts full mission polarization map depth of 0.62~$\mu$K$_{\rm CMB}$-arcmin.


% \begin{itemize}
% \item Total full sky map sensitivity, compare to Planck, LB, and S4? or do so in intro?
% \end{itemize}
% simple telescope. low noise? low systematics? - systematics not discussed elsewhere (yet)


% some of this phrasing here.
% From this analysis we see that all noise sources depend on $P_{abs}$, either directly or through how load drives bolometer properties.  
% Therefore the 
% most straightforward way to reduce noise is to limit all optical loads other than the CMB.  This motivates the simple, few element telescope we 
% have designed with the aperture stop and secondary mirror actively cooled to reduce excess load and photon noise.
